/*
 * Exercise 1 - compute_payoff_amount 

 * Compute the amount left on a loan after days_since_loan_started
 * days. Payments of the specified payment amount are done every
 * payment_interval days.
 *
 * initial: initial loan amount (initial > 0)
 * payment: amount of each payment (payment > 0)
 * days_since_loan_started: the number of days since the loan started.
 *   This value may be negative, zero, or positive
 * payment_interval: payments are made every payment_interval number of days.  The first payment
 *  is made on day payment_interval.
 *
 * Returns: the amount left to payoff the loan as a double
 *
 * sample calls: 
 *    compute_payoff_amount(100.0, 2.0, 1, 1) yields 98.0
 *    compute_payoff_amount(100.0, 2.0, 5, 7) yields 100.0
